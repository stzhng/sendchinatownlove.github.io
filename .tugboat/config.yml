services:
  # What to call the service hosting the site. Because there is only
  # one service, it is automatically set as the default service, which
  # does a few things
  #   1. Clones the git repository into the service container
  #   2. Exposes port 80 to the Tugboat HTTP proxy
  #   3. Routes requests to the preview URL to this service
  apache:
    # Use the available version of Apache by not specifying a version
    image: tugboatqa/httpd

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:
      # Commands that set up the basic preview infrastructure
      init:
        # Use curl to download Hugo into the Apache service
        - curl -s https://install-node.now.sh | bash -s -- --yes

      build:
        # Hugo's command to build your static site
        - yarn install
        - yarn run build

        # Link the document root to the expected path. This example links the
        # /public directory generated by the Hugo build to the docroot
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/build" "${DOCROOT}"
